# Webcam Live Streaming with Flask

This project demonstrates how to create a simple webcam live streaming application using Flask and OpenCV (cv2). It captures video from the webcam and streams it over a web interface using Flask's server-sent events. Users can access the live stream by visiting the specified URL.

## Features

- **Real-time Webcam Streaming:** Capture video from the webcam and stream it live over the web.
- **Simple HTML Interface:** Provides a basic HTML interface for viewing the live stream.
- **Responsive Design:** The interface is designed to work well on different screen sizes.
- **Cross-Platform:** Works on various operating systems supporting Python, Flask, and OpenCV.

## Requirements

To run this application, you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- OpenCV (cv2)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Install the required Python dependencies using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
2. Run the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. Once the application is running, open a web browser and visit `http://localhost:5000/` to view the live stream.

## How It Works

- The Flask application (`app.py`) initializes the webcam using OpenCV.
- It defines a route `/video` to stream the webcam feed as a series of JPEG frames.
- The HTML template (`index.html`) embeds the video stream using an `<img>` tag with a dynamic source attribute pointing to the `/video` route.
- When a user accesses the root URL, they are presented with the HTML interface containing the live stream.
